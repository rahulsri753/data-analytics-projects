### Data Cleaning using Python

Project Overview:

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning workflow using Python to prepare raw data for accurate analysis. The dataset contained real-world issues such as missing values, duplicate records, outliers, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types, which were systematically identified and resolved.

Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas

Jupyter Notebook

Data Cleaning Steps Performed:

Identified and handled missing values using appropriate techniques

Removed duplicate records to ensure data consistency

Detected and removed outliers using statistical methods (IQR-based approach)

Corrected inconsistent data formats

Converted columns to appropriate data types for analysis

Renamed columns for clarity and better readability

Performed validation checks to ensure data quality

Final Outcome:

Clean and structured dataset

Reduced noise and improved data accuracy

Dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
