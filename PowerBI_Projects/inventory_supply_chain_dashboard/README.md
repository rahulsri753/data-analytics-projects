# Inventory Supply Chain Dashboard | Power BI

## Objective
To analyze inventory and supply chain performance across regions and product categories, and identify opportunities for inventory optimization, cost reduction, and improved order fulfillment.

## Business Problem
Inefficient inventory planning and supply chain visibility can lead to stockouts, excess inventory, increased logistics costs, and delayed order fulfillment. This project focuses on improving visibility into inventory levels, lead times, warehouse utilization, and transportation costs.

## Key Metrics & KPIs
- Inventory Level  
- Inventory Turnover  
- Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)  
- Lead Time (Days)  
- Warehouse Utilization (%)  
- Transportation Cost  
- Units Sold (Year-wise)  
- Backorder Count by Order Status  

## Tools Used
- Power BI  
- Power Query  
- DAX  
- Excel (data source)  

## Dashboard Analysis & Insights
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to track inventory levels, warehouse utilization, lead time, and transportation cost.
- Analyzed inventory distribution by product category and region to identify overstocking and understocking patterns.
- Evaluated average lead time by category to highlight supply chain delays.
- Observed warehouse utilization at *34.08%*, indicating capacity optimization opportunities.
- Analyzed year-wise units sold trends, showing strong growth after 2021.
- Reviewed order fulfillment performance using backorder status (Fulfilled, Pending, Canceled).
- Applied slicers for region and category to enable dynamic and drill-down analysis.

## Key Outcomes
- Improved supply chain visibility for data-driven decision-making.
- Identified areas for inventory and warehouse optimization.
- Highlighted opportunities to reduce lead time and transportation costs.
- Supported better order fulfillment and inventory planning decisions.
